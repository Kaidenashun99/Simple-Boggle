This assignment was extremely hard for me. There were a ton of methods and classes to write and we also had to think about how to go about the lengthy analysis. 
It felt like forever to figure out BoardFirstAutoplayer, and doing the extra credit was a pain in the ass, but it was rewarding to finally
have it all done and internalize all the backtracking and recursion.

Making it easy to record all the data was also tricky.
